# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

A bullet hell game, the player is confined to a certain area, but the enemy can be moving outside of that player confined area. I was thinking of the theme/model should be Terraria, if no trouble occur using those models.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Henry Luong

## Do you have any questions of your own?

As of this time, no other questions.
